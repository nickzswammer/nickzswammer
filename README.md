## About Me

Electrical Engineering student at Purdue University (Class of 2028)

I enjoy building systems end-to-end from power architecture and PCB layout to register-level firmware and protocol debugging.

## Experience

I'm involved in Purdue's IEEE ROV team as the electrical hardware lead developing a six board stackup and Purdue SoCET (System on Chip design team) as an embedded software developer to integrate USB 1.1 into the SoC.

I have various projects revolving around embedded systems (STM32, ESP32), and am currently working on a Guitar DSP development board for me to explore DSP, analog design, and firmware!
