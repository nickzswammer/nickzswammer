## About Me

Electrical Engineering student at Purdue University (Class of 2028)

I enjoy building systems end-to-end from power architecture and PCB layout to register-level firmware and protocol debugging.

## Experience

### IEEE Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) – Electrical Boards Lead  
- Led design of six 4-layer PCBs (KiCad)
- Designed 48V → 12V/5V power distribution supporting 1440W operation  
- Routed high-current thruster paths and validated designs via simulation + datasheet analysis  
- Managed full BOM creation and board bring-up

## Selected Projects

### Custom USB Host Controller Driver (RISC-V SoC)
- Implementing low-level USB host firmware in C  
- Handling enumeration, transfers, and interrupt management  
- Debugging via register inspection and logic analyzer traces  

### ESP32 E-Paper Clock (Custom PCB)
- Designed 4-layer PCB with power management + SPI routing  
- Implemented low-power firmware with MOSFET-based switching  
- Optimized layout for signal integrity and enclosure constraints  

### STM32 Bare-Metal Sensor System
- Wrote CMSIS register-level drivers (no HAL)  
- Implemented timing-sensitive sensor + LCD interface  
- Structured modular, testable embedded firmware
